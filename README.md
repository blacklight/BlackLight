I generally like to build things that solve problems with code and data.

### 🛠️ Notable Repositories

- [Platypush](https://github.com/blacklight/platypush). That's the main project I have been working on over the past couple of years. With the motto "build anything, automate everything", it's a general-purpose platform to connect integrations (covering everything from MQTT to cameras, from smart lights to Google services, from Arduino and ESP8266 devices to machine learning models, from social and messaging platforms to calendars, and so on) to one another through a consistent UI and backend interface. It also enables users to create arbitrary complex automation routines when events happen. It also comes with a powerful [web extension](https://github.com/BlackLight/platypush-webext).

- [GPSTracker](https://github.com/blacklight/gpstracker): a full-featured self-hosted Web app to store your GPS data points, render them on timelines, search for activities by geographical area or time, and run statistics on them.

- [nvim-http](https://github.com/blacklight/nvim-http): a plugin to run HTTP request files in nvim. Inspired by (and compatible with) the HTTP requests plugins provided by JetBrains and VSCode.

- [madblog](https://github.com/blacklight/madblog): a minimal, but powerfully elegant, blogging platform. No database, no JavaScript, only pure Markdown. It can run a visually appealing blog from any Markdown folder.

- [micmon](https://github.com/blacklight/micmon): a general-purpose Python library and set of tools for audio detection through Fourier analysis and Tensorflow.

- [theremin](https://github.com/blacklight/theremin): a contactless, hands-in-air digital implementation of a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) musical instrument through a Leap Motion device.

- [Snort_AIPreproc](https://github.com/blacklight/Snort_AIPreproc): a machine learning module for the intrusion detection system Snort that removes the noise from the logs, clusters similar alerts together, finds common causal links between alerts and predicts the next step in a multi-step attack scenario.

- [fsom](https://github.com/blacklight/fsom): a C library for managing [Self-Organizing Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map).

- [fkmeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map): a C library to perform [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

- [nash](https://github.com/blacklight/nash): a small program to analyze Nash equilibrium situations in scenarios where the initial costs are known.

- [Voxifera](https://github.com/BlackLight/Voxifera): (probably) one of the earliest examples of voice assistants I'm aware of - I built it back in 2008 but it's largely discontinued now.

Plus, you'll probably find me collaborating to a few other dozens of repos - since Platypush comes with lots of integrations I often come to work closely with developers of other projects.

I also write technical articles (mostly about usages of Platypush to solve home automation, IoT and machine learning problems) that you can find, among the others, on [Medium](https://automationguru.medium.com/), on [my website](https://fabiomanganiello.com/) and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/BlackLight).
