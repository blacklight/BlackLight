I generally like to build things that solve problems with code and data. Among my open-source repositories you'll find:

- [Platypush](https://github.com/BlackLight/platypush). That's the main project I have been working on over the past couple of years. With the motto "build anything, automate everything", it's a general-purpose platform to connect integrations (covering everything from MQTT to cameras, from smart lights to Google services, from Arduino and ESP8266 devices to machine learning models, from social and messaging platforms to calendars, and so on) to one another through a consistent UI and backend interface. It also enables users to create arbitrary complex automation routines when events happen. It also comes with a powerful [web extension](https://github.com/BlackLight/platypush-webext).

- [micmon](https://github.com/BlackLight/micmon) - a general-purpose Python library and set of tools for audio detection through Fourier analysis and Tensorflow.

- [theremin](https://github.com/BlackLight/theremin), an touchless, hands-in-air digital implementation of a [Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) musical instrument through a Leap Motion device.

- [Snort_AIPreproc](https://github.com/BlackLight/Snort_AIPreproc), a machine learning module for the intrusion detection system Snort that removes the noise from the logs, clusters similar alerts together, finds common causal links between alerts and predicts the next step in a multi-step attack scenario.

- [fsom](https://github.com/BlackLight/fsom), a C library for managing [Self-Organizing Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map).

- [fkmeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map), a C library to perform [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

- [nash](https://github.com/BlackLight/nash), a small program to analyze Nash equilibrium situations in scenarios where the initial costs are known.

- [Voxifera](https://github.com/BlackLight/Voxifera), (probably) one of the earliest examples of voice assistants I'm aware of - I built it back in 2008 but it's largely discontinued now.

Plus, you'll probably find me collaborating to a few other dozens of repos - since Platypush comes with lots of integrations I often come to work closely with developers of other projects.

I also write technical articles (mostly about usages of Platypush to solve home automation, IoT and machine learning problems) that you can find, among the others, on [Medium](https://automationguru.medium.com/), on [my website](https://fabiomanganiello.com/) and [HackerNoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/BlackLight).

🏆 My contributions have been awarded with the [IoT contributor of the year 2020 HackerNoon prize](https://noonies.tech/award/hacker-noon-contributor-of-the-year-iot).

👯 Currently looking for collaborators to help me with Platypush - it's starting to be a quite large beast and I'd love to have more developers building more integrations and more testers testing them.

Things I enjoy when AFK:

- 🎸 Play, record, produce and perform
- 🏄 Chase waves
- 🍺 Enjoy craft beer
- 👪 Grow a new geek
